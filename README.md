Duration:Nov to Dec 2024                                                                                                                                                                                 

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT:IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION USING COMPUTER VISION                                                                                                                                         
Objective:                                                                                                                                                                                               
The project focuses on building a user-friendly web-based application for image detection using computer vision principles. Users can upload an image, and the system identifies the object(s) depicted, displaying the detection results in real-time.                                                                                                                                                                   
Key Features:                                                                                                                                                                                            
1.Image Upload Interface:                                                                                                                                                                                
       Users can upload any image file using an intuitive drag-and-drop or file selection interface.Provides real-time feedback by previewing the uploaded image in the browser.                         
2.Mock Detection Algorithm:                                                                                                                                                                              
       The current version uses a basic string matching technique to "detect" objects based on the image file's name.If the file name includes keywords (e.g., "cat", "dog"), the application extracts and displays the object's name.A fallback detection assigns a default label ("Dog") if no match is found.                                                                                                
3.Interactive Frontend:                                                                                                                                                                                  
       Uses HTML and CSS for structure and styling, ensuring a clean and responsive design.A <div> section dynamically displays the uploaded image and detection results.                                
4.Dynamic Behavior via JavaScript:                                                                                                                                                                       
       FileReader API handles image file processing and displays the preview in the browser.The detection logic runs in real-time upon image upload, ensuring an interactive experience.
